I build web applications, for fun and for profit, currently working with Javascript libraries and frameworks. 

Oh and of-course, HTML and CSS were starting points.

I'm a passionate and dedicated, results-oriented  and technically-insightful Software Engineer polished in optimising systems to address dynamic needs.
